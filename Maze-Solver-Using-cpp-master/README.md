This project is a console-based C++ application that generates a random maze and solves it using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Users input the maze size and wall density, and the program creates a maze grid where walls are represented by 'X', paths by spaces, the start point by '@', and the end point by '*'. The BFS algorithm finds the shortest path from start to end, marking the solution path with dots ('.') if one exists. The maze is randomly generated with varying wall densities based on user input, ensuring unique mazes each run. Both the generated maze and its solved path are displayed in the console for clear visualization. To use the project, clone the repository, compile the code with a C++ compiler like g++, and run the executable. Follow the prompts to enter maze parameters and watch the maze generation and solving process in real-time. This project is a great exercise in graph traversal algorithms and procedural maze generation
